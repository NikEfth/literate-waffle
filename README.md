## How to download and use

Git is a great tool to help you have always the latest version without much fuzz. In addition, you may submit comments, isssues and requests without the hassle of emails. Moreover if you deside to contribute your own code you can do it in a transparent, trackable way  and be available to everybody immediately. 

### How to gets started

This is a public repository (you might regard it as a shared folder). You can access it freely but you will need an application to do that. Lucky for you there are hundreds free out there. 

A small list would include: 

* https://gitforwindows.org/

* https://desktop.github.com/ (official)

* https://www.gitkraken.com/

  â€‹

Moreover there are tons of training videos and ppts and pdfs to help you get started.
Essentially the only thing you have to do, after you download one of the aforementioned applications is to select "open new repository" ( located somewhere in their options) and paste the link of this repository git@github.com:NikEfth/literate-waffle.git or https://github.com/NikEfth/literate-waffle.git. Both link to the same location. 

Then press clone which is the equivalent of "sync" and a folder in your system will contain the same, up-to-date, files as mine. 

Finaly, if you create a github account (is up to you) and you press the watch icon (near the top of the page) whenever I upload new files or make correction a notification will arrive to your email. In addition, you will get to submit issues and requests. 

That would be all, 
Good Luck, 
Nikos
